RatBoi is a remote access trojan (RAT) program written in Java. It is designed to give a user remote access to one or more machines on a network.

The RatBoi program consists of two parts: the server and the client. The server is a GUI-based Java application, which acts as a hub for all client connections. It allows the user to send commands to the connected clients, and view their output.

The client is a lightweight Java application, which can be installed on a machine on the same network as the server. It connects to the server and will accept and execute any commands sent to it.

RatBoi is designed to be an easy-to-use, lightweight RAT program. It has a simple GUI and is straightforward to set up and use. It is a great option for users who need to manage multiple machines on the same network.
